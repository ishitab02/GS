        <h2>To Clean a Creek</h2>
        <p id="storyText">
                The Araguaia River is one of the biggest rivers in
                Brazil. It is the home to thousands of animals, like
                bright blue and yellow Macaws. River dolphins
                swim and play in the water, and there are many
                different coloured fish.<br><br>
                
                In one town, a 13-year-old child named <span id="characterName"></span>
                walks along the river every day. But looking at the
                river makes him worry because there is trash
                everywhere. He sees plastic bottles, old clothing,
                and empty food packages. The water looks dark
                and ugly.<br><br>
                
                At school, <span id="characterName"></span> asks about the dirty river. “You
                wouldn’t want trash in your house,” says his
                teacher. “Think about the poor animals!”
                For days, <span id="characterName"></span> couldn’t stop thinking about the
                river. It doesn’t seem right to him that this big,
                powerful river is filled with trash. “It’s hurting the
                animals in my area,” he thinks. “And it’s also hurting
                the families who live here.”
                Then <span id="characterName"></span> has an idea.<br><br>
                
                The next morning, <span id="characterName"></span> talks to his mother
                about his plan for the river. He wants to go around
                his town and ask for everyone’s help. Maybe if they
                all work together, they could clean up the river!
                his mother loves his idea, “I believe the most
                important thing for you, <span id="characterName"></span>, is learning how to
                change things that you care about. That will stay
                with you forever.” She tells him she will help him all
                along the way.<br><br>
                
                The next day, <span id="characterName"></span> goes to the police department.
                And then he goes to the Mayor’s office. He visits other
                schools, and offices, and businesses.
                Soon he has a very big group of people who like his
                idea!
                They all decide to meet at the river the next week. On
                the day of the river cleanup, <span id="characterName"></span> is excited - but he
                is also nervous. What if no one shows up?
                But when he and his mother arrive, there are almost a
                hundred people there, including many of his
                friends.<br><br>
                
                Over an entire day, they all work together to clean
                up the trash. They pick it up off the shore of the
                bank and pull it out of the water.
                When they are done, they have picked up almost a
                tonne of trash - that’s the same weight as a car!
                As they work, <span id="characterName"></span> notices how everyone is
                laughing and smiling. “It feels good to help our
                community,” he thinks.<br><br>
                
                Once they have finished cleaning, they all talk in a
                big group. “We want to stop this problem from
                happening again,” says one woman.
                The town decides to start with education. They
                want to teach everyone why throwing trash in the
                river is harmful.
                They also plan to help the river by planting more
                trees along the riverbank for birds and insects to
                live in.<br><br>
                
                At the end of the day, everyone starts to applaud.
                They’re proud of the change that they’ve made -
                and the river rushes along beside them, clean and
                clear.
                “We wouldn’t have done it without you,” they say to
                <span id="characterName"></span>. “Thank you for inspiring us to create
                change! What should we do together next?”
